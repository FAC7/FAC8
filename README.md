# FAC8
Planning FAC8

### Notes on Stop Go Continue for FAC7 content
#### Continue
* Tutorials instead of READMEs

#### Go
* TDD week: Ask people to spike/build without tests, then scrap and build again with TDD.
* Auth week: Include JWTs in workshop - necessity for Auth so should be more than just a README topic
* Auth week: Touch on creating a secure server - admin roles, authentication structures
* Databases: we need broader knowledge of databases more than we need sockets. So switch out sockets for another database?
* Databases: we should be able to choose the right database for the project - PostgreSQL seems a pretty good 2nd choice
* API week: 
 * Give a pre-made server without going through how to make one?
 * OR, provide a list of APIs which do not require a server
* General: learn how to make good documentation
* General: debugging morning challenges. 
* General: technical talks are better towards the end of the course, e.g. on security, databases, node.
* CSS: Should we bring in Bootstrap/Materialise/FlexBox earlier in the course and encourage students to learn them and use them in course projects?
* React: Make the initial walkthrough less ambitious. Too much compressed into too little time.
* React: Demystify things like babelrc, webpack etc.

#### Stop
* Making READMEs and not reading them.

#### Misc
* More help on how to write good, testable code - OOP concepts? Encapsulation? Good practices
* Think about Facebook with Oauth - people should be aware of what is on offer
* Build a game? Direct them to tutorials? Something simple, where they can use TDD?
* More pre-course direction: direct them to [Git tutorial](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)?
* Promises: learn them earlier?
* ES6: Have a workshop in week 3/4/5 to introduce key functionality.
